## Whats Next.

- search for `FIXIT` globally and fix whatever issue is there
- search for `@ts-ignore` globally and and fix them
- try to remove all `any` whit proper types

### Optionally do:

- wherever index is used as key value, replace them with any value coming form iterated object. (its a good practice)

## Removed code, need to migrate

- location.state files are removed need to implement them in next.js way.
